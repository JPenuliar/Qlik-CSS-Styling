# Qlik CSS Styling

This repository provides ready-to-use and customizable CSS snippets for styling Qlik objects. Styles are authored to be applied either as sheet-level CSS or bundled into Qlik extensions.

Key points
- Focus: customizing visual appearance of Qlik Sense objects (charts, tables, KPIs, containers, etc.) using CSS.
- Where to use: paste into a sheet/theme custom CSS area, include in a theme, or embed inside extension CSS files.
- Purpose: accelerate consistent styling across apps and extensions without rewriting styles for each object.

Getting started
1. Browse the `css/` (or similarly named) folder for categorized style snippets.
2. Copy a snippet into your sheet's custom CSS or into an extension's stylesheet.
3. Adjust selectors and variables to match your app object IDs/classes as needed.
4. Test in a development app before deploying to production.

Examples
- Sheet CSS: paste selector and rules directly into the sheet's custom CSS editor.
- Extension: include the CSS file in the extension bundle and reference it from the extension's HTML.
